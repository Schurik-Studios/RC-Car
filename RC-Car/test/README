RC Body Unit (Vehicle)
Overview:

    The RC body receives controller commands over ESP-NOW and operates:

    DC motor (Forward / Backward / Stop)

    Servo motor for steering

    The unit also sends telemetry back to the controller.

Motion Control/ Motor Control:

The RC body uses an H-Bridge motor driver to switch between forward and reverse motion. The ESP32 controls the H-Bridge using two digital pins (IN1 / IN2):

    F → IN1 = HIGH, IN2 = LOW (Forward)

    B → IN1 = LOW, IN2 = HIGH (Backward)

    S → IN1 = LOW, IN2 = LOW (Stop)

    This allows clean and reliable direction control without PWM for this setup.

Steering Logic:

    The system uses incremental steering to achieve smoother, more realistic motion:

    Steering updates every 20 ms

Telemetry:

    Current servo angle

    Current driving command

    Telemetry is sent every 500 ms.

Controller Unit (Transmitter)
Overview:

    The controller reads movement inputs from a two‑axis analog joystick and translates them into:

    Steering angle (converted to a 50°–130° servo range)

    Steering speed profile (0 = instant, 1 = slow, 2 = fast)

    Driving direction (Forward, Backward, Stop)

    Processed control data is sent to the vehicle as a formatted ESP-NOW message. The controller also receives telemetry packets from the RC body.

Input & Control Logic:

    Joystick X-axis → steering angle

    Joystick Y-axis → drive direction

    Joystick movement magnitude → steering speed

    Deadzone filtering reduces noise around the center position

    ESP-NOW sends data every 100 ms

    Telemetry Handling

The controller receives:

    Current steering angle

    Current direction

    (Extendable for velocity or battery level)

    Incoming telemetry is printed via the Serial Monitor for debugging.
